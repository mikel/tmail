  * Fixed bug where re-assigning the mail.body to an existing mail object that already had a parsed body would not re-parse the body.
  * Started documenting the source code... lots more to do.

=== 1.1.0 / 2007-10-28

* 1 minor enhancements:
  * Changed the quoting of paramaters in the header fields to wrap double quotes around fields that are needed to be quoted.
  * Removed keeping double quotes around a filename that does not need double quotes per RFC 1521
  * More clean up and getting tests passing.  Now standing at 2 failures out of 3366 assertions.  One is the incorrect handling of "@"@test.com (returns @@test.com) and the other is a japanese encoding issue.
